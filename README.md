### Standard Cleanup Operations (12 Functions)

1. **System Updates** - Update package lists and upgrade all installed packages with reboot detection
2. **APT Package Cleanup** - Remove unused packages, clean package cache, and purge residual configuration files
3. **System Journal Cleanup** - Manage systemd journal logs by time or size limits
4. **User-Level Cleanup** - Empty trash and remove thumbnail caches
5. **Flatpak & Snap Cleanup** - Remove unused Flatpak runtimes and old Snap revisions
6. **AppImage Management** - Interactive removal of AppImage files with size analysis
7. **Old Kernel Cleanup** - Safely remove old kernel versions while keeping current and one previous
8. **Docker Cleanup** - Comprehensive Docker cleanup (containers, images, volumes, system-wide prune)
9. **Browser Cache Cleanup** - Clean caches for Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, and Brave browsers
10. **User Cache Directory Management** - Manage ~/.cache subdirectories with warnings for critical caches
11. **System Coredump Cleanup** - Remove crash dump files from failed applications
12. **Python Package Cache Cleanup** - Purge pip/pip3 cache to free up space

### Advanced Operations (1 Function)

13. **Orphaned Libraries Removal** - Find and remove orphaned libraries using deborphan (use with caution)

### Additional Features

- **Real-time disk space tracking** - See how much space each operation frees
- **Color-coded disk usage display** - Visual indicators for disk usage levels (green/yellow/red)
- **Comprehensive logging** - All operations logged to `~/.ubuntu-cleaner.log`
- **Interactive confirmations** - Review changes before applying them
- **Safety checks** - Warnings for critical operations and version verification
- **Dry-run previews** - See what will be removed before confirming
- **Error handling** - Graceful error handling with informative messages

## Supported Operating Systems

- **Primary**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Compatible**: Ubuntu 22.04, 20.04, and other Debian-based distributions

The script will warn you if running on a version other than Ubuntu 24.04 but allows you to proceed.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- sudo privileges
- Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux distribution

### Optional Dependencies

The script will automatically detect and work with these tools if installed:

- `flatpak` - For Flatpak cleanup
- `snap` - For Snap cleanup
- `docker` - For Docker cleanup
- `pip3` - For Python package cache cleanup
- `deborphan` - For orphaned library detection (automatically installed when you select the advanced cleanup option)

**Note about deborphan**: When you select the advanced orphaned libraries removal option (Step x), the script will automatically check if `deborphan` is installed. If not found, it will prompt you and install it automatically using:

```bash
sudo apt install deborphan -y
```

You can also install it manually beforehand:

```bash
sudo apt install deborphan
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/ubuntu-cleaner/releases) page
2. Download the latest `ubuntu-cleaner-vX.X.X.zip`
3. Extract and install:

```bash
unzip ubuntu-cleaner-vX.X.X.zip
cd ubuntu-cleaner-vX.X.X
bash install.sh
./ubuntu-cleaner.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Download

1. Download the script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/ubuntu-cleaner/main/ubuntu-cleaner.sh
```

2. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ubuntu-cleaner.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./ubuntu-cleaner.sh
```

## Usage

### Interactive Menu

Run the script and select operations from the interactive menu:

```bash
./ubuntu-cleaner.sh
```

The menu displays:

- Current disk usage with color-coded indicators
- Numbered cleanup options
- Utility functions (view/clear logs)
- Advanced operations
- Quick "Run All" option

### Menu Options

- **1-12**: Individual cleanup operations
- **l**: View cleanup log
- **c**: Clear log file
- **x**: Advanced orphaned library removal
- **a**: Run all standard cleanup steps automatically
- **q**: Quit the script

### Example Workflow

1. Run the script: `./ubuntu-cleaner.sh`
2. Review disk usage at the top of the menu
3. Select option `a` to run all standard cleanups
4. Review and confirm each operation
5. Check the log with option `l` to see what was cleaned

## Safety Features

- **Confirmation prompts** - Every destructive operation requires user confirmation
- **Dry-run previews** - See what will be removed before confirming
- **Current kernel protection** - Always keeps current and one previous kernel
- **Critical cache warnings** - Alerts for font, graphics, and system caches
- **Size calculations** - Shows how much space will be freed
- **Comprehensive logging** - All actions logged with timestamps
- **Error handling** - Graceful failures with informative messages

## Log File

All operations are logged to: `~/.ubuntu-cleaner.log`

View the log:

- From the menu: Select option `l`
- Manually: `less ~/.ubuntu-cleaner.log`

Clear the log:

- From the menu: Select option `c`
- Manually: `rm ~/.ubuntu-cleaner.log`

## Disk Space Indicators

The menu displays color-coded disk usage:

- üü¢ **Green**: < 75% used (healthy)
- üü° **Yellow**: 75-90% used (monitor)
- üî¥ **Red**: > 90% used (critical)

## Important Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser Cache Cleanup

Close all browsers before cleaning their caches to avoid data corruption.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker Cleanup

Removing Docker volumes permanently deletes data. Ensure you have backups.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Old Kernel Cleanup

The script keeps your current kernel and one previous version for safety. Removed kernels cannot be booted into.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Cache Directories

Some caches (fontconfig, mesa_shader_cache, nvidia) are critical for system performance. They will be rebuilt automatically but may cause temporary slowdowns.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Orphan Removal (deborphan)

**For experienced users only!** This feature uses `deborphan` to find and remove orphaned libraries that appear to have no dependencies. However:

- Misidentification can break software dependencies
- Some packages may be incorrectly flagged as orphaned
- Always review the list carefully before confirming removal
- The script will automatically install `deborphan` if not present

**What happens when you select this option:**

1. Script checks if `deborphan` is installed
2. If not found, it automatically installs it with your permission
3. Scans for orphaned packages
4. Shows you the list for review
5. Requires explicit confirmation before removal
